## 🔍 Overview

lib-wallet-store provides a consistent interface for wallet data storage, allowing developers to choose or implement the storage engine that best fits their needs. Whether you need in-memory storage, file-based persistence, or distributed data structures, lib-wallet-store offers a unified API to work with various backend technologies.

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 Consistent key-value storage API
- 🔌 Pluggable storage engine architecture
- 🔄 Asynchronous operations
- 🧩 Support for multiple instances
- 🔐 Designed for wallet data management


## 🔧 Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use lib-wallet-store with the Hyperbee engine:

```javascript
const { WalletStoreHyperbee } = require('lib-wallet-store');

async function example() {
  const store = new WalletStoreHyperbee({});
  await store.init();

  await store.put('key1', 'value1');
  const value = await store.get('key1');
  console.log(value); // Outputs: value1

  await store.close();
}

example();
```

## 💾 Storage Engines

lib-wallet-store currently supports the following storage engines:

1. [**Hyperbee Engine**](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperbee): Utilizes the Hyperbee data structure for efficient and distributed storage.

To implement a new storage engine:

1. Create a new class that extends the base `WalletStore` class.
2. Implement the required methods: `init()`, `get()`, `put()`, `delete()`, `clear()`, `close()`, etc.
3. Place your implementation in the project's root directory (e.g., `wallet-store-yourenginename.js`).

## 🛠 Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tetherto/lib-wallet-store.git
   cd lib-wallet-store
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start coding! 👨‍💻👩‍💻

## 🧪 Testing

We use the [Brittle](https://github.com/holepunchto/brittle) testing framework for our unit tests.

To run the tests:

1. Make sure you have the testing dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   npm install brittle
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
